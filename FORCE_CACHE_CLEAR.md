# ðŸš¨ FORCE CACHE CLEAR DEPLOYMENT

## Problem Identified
- Frontend Nginx had `expires 1y` and `Cache-Control "public, immutable"`
- This caused aggressive caching preventing updates from showing
- Changes not visible after 1+ hour despite successful deployments

## Solution Applied
1. **Disabled aggressive caching** in `crysgarage-frontend/nginx.conf`
2. **Changed cache headers** to `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
3. **Set expires to 0** to force immediate updates

## Deployment Steps
1. This file triggers GitHub Actions
2. Forces complete Docker rebuild with `--no-cache`
3. Restarts all services with new cache settings
4. Should resolve the caching issue immediately

## Expected Result
- Changes should be visible within 2-3 minutes
- No more caching delays
- All static assets will be served fresh

**Deployment timestamp: $(date)**
