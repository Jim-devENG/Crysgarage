# Audio Loading Issues - Complete Fix Documentation

## Problem Description

The user was experiencing two related issues:

### 1. Blob URL Reloading Issue

Rapid reloading of blob URLs in the audio mastering interface. The console showed:

```
Original URL: blob:http://localhost:5173/87bf436e-ddbe-4ded-aecc-2e250ff9acf8
```

This URL was constantly changing and reloading, causing performance issues.

### 2. "Audio file not found" Error

The component was showing "Audio file not found" errors even when the original file was available, because it was trying to load mastering results from the API unnecessarily.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Blob URL Reloading

The issue was in the `MasteringResults.tsx` component. The problem was on lines 113-115:

```typescript
const originalAudioUrl = originalFile
  ? URL.createObjectURL(originalFile)
  : masteringResults?.original_audio_url || null;
```

**The Problem:**

- `URL.createObjectURL()` was being called on every component render
- This created a new blob URL each time the component re-rendered
- The component re-rendered frequently due to debug logging and state updates
- This caused the audio element to reload constantly with new blob URLs

### Issue 2: Unnecessary API Calls

The component was trying to load mastering results from the API even when the original file was available:

```typescript
// Only try to load from API if we have an audioId and no masteredResult
if (audioId && !masteredResult) {
  const results = await audioAPI.getMasteringResults(audioId);
  // ...
}
```

**The Problem:**

- Component tried to load from API even when `originalFile` was available
- This caused 404 errors when the audio ID didn't exist in the backend
- The error handling was too aggressive and showed errors even when data was available

## Solution Applied

### 1. Memoized Blob URL Creation

Used `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary blob URL recreation:

```typescript
const originalAudioUrl = useMemo(() => {
  if (originalFile) {
    return URL.createObjectURL(originalFile);
  }
  return masteringResults?.original_audio_url || null;
}, [originalFile, masteringResults?.original_audio_url]);
```

### 2. Added Proper Cleanup

Added cleanup effect to prevent memory leaks:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    // Clean up blob URLs to prevent memory leaks
    if (originalAudioUrl && originalAudioUrl.startsWith("blob:")) {
      URL.revokeObjectURL(originalAudioUrl);
    }
  };
}, [originalAudioUrl]);
```

### 3. Reduced Debug Logging Frequency

Modified debug logging to reduce re-render frequency:

```typescript
// Before: Logged on every render with full objects
console.log("Original file:", originalFile);
console.log("Mastering results:", masteringResults);

// After: Logged only when important values change
console.log("Original file:", originalFile?.name);
console.log("Mastering results loaded:", !!masteringResults);
```

### 4. Added React Keys to Audio Elements

Added unique keys to help React better manage audio elements:

```typescript
<audio
  key={`original-${audioId}-${originalFile?.name}`}
  ref={originalAudioRef}
  src={finalOriginalUrl}
  // ... other props
/>
```

### 5. Memoized Analysis Data

Memoized the analysis data to prevent unnecessary recalculations:

```typescript
const analysisData = useMemo(
  () => ({
    originalLoudness: masteringResults?.original_loudness || -18.2,
    masteredLoudness:
      masteringResults?.mastered_loudness ||
      masteredResult?.metadata?.final_lufs ||
      -14.0,
    // ... other properties
  }),
  [masteringResults, masteredResult?.metadata]
);
```

### 6. Improved API Call Logic

Modified the API call logic to prioritize original file over API calls:

```typescript
// Only try to load from API if we have an audioId, no masteredResult, and no originalFile
if (audioId && !masteredResult && !originalFile) {
  const results = await audioAPI.getMasteringResults(audioId);
  setMasteringResults(results);
} else if (originalFile) {
  // If we have originalFile, we can show the interface without API call
  console.log("Using original file, skipping API call");
  setMasteringResults(null);
}
```

### 7. Improved Error Handling

Made error handling less aggressive when original file is available:

```typescript
// Only show error if we don't have original file or mastered result
if (!originalFile && !masteredResult) {
  setAudioError(errorMessage);
} else {
  console.log("API error ignored - using available data");
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`crysgarage-frontend/components/MasteringResults.tsx`**

   - Added `useMemo` import
   - Memoized blob URL creation
   - Added proper cleanup for blob URLs
   - Reduced debug logging frequency
   - Added React keys to audio elements
   - Memoized analysis data

2. **`test_blob_url_fix.html`** (new file)
   - Created test file to demonstrate the issue and verify the fix

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Open `test_blob_url_fix.html` in a browser
2. Click "Test Original Behavior" to see the problematic behavior
3. Click "Test Fixed Behavior" to see the corrected behavior
4. The fixed behavior should reuse the same blob URL instead of creating new ones

## Expected Results

After the fix:

- ✅ Blob URLs are created only once per file
- ✅ No more rapid reloading of audio URLs
- ✅ Better performance and reduced memory usage
- ✅ Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- ✅ Audio elements are stable and don't reload unnecessarily
- ✅ No more "Audio file not found" errors when original file is available
- ✅ Component prioritizes original file over API calls
- ✅ Improved error handling that doesn't show errors when data is available

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always use `useMemo` for expensive operations** like `URL.createObjectURL()`
2. **Clean up blob URLs** when components unmount or URLs change
3. **Minimize debug logging** that triggers re-renders
4. **Use React keys** for elements that should be stable
5. **Memoize computed values** that depend on props or state

## Related Issues

This fix also addresses:

- Performance degradation from constant re-renders
- Memory leaks from uncleaned blob URLs
- Audio playback interruptions
- Excessive network requests for audio files
