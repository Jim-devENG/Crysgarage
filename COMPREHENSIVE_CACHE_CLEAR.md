# üö® COMPREHENSIVE CACHE CLEAR DEPLOYMENT

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND
Multiple Nginx configuration files were still using aggressive caching:

### Files Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ `crysgarage-frontend/nginx.conf` - Fixed
2. ‚úÖ `crysgarage-frontend/nginx-config.conf` - Fixed
3. ‚úÖ `nginx_config.conf` - Fixed  
4. ‚úÖ `ssl_config.conf` - Fixed
5. ‚úÖ `nginx-docker.conf` - Added cache-busting headers

### Problem:
- **4 different Nginx configs** all had `expires 1y` and `Cache-Control "public, immutable"`
- Deployment might have been using any of these configs
- This explains why changes weren't showing up for 1+ hour

### Solution Applied:
- **Disabled ALL caching** across all config files
- **Added cache-busting headers** to main proxy
- **Set expires to 0** everywhere
- **Added Pragma no-cache** headers

## üöÄ Deployment Steps:
1. This triggers complete rebuild
2. All Nginx configs updated
3. Docker containers rebuilt with new settings
4. All caches cleared at multiple levels

## ‚è±Ô∏è Expected Result:
- **Changes should be visible within 2-3 minutes**
- **No more caching delays**
- **All static assets served fresh**

**Deployment timestamp: $(date)**
**Status: ALL CACHE CONFIGS FIXED**
