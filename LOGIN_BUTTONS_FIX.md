# 🔧 Login & Get Started Buttons Fix

## ✅ Problem Identified

The login button and "Get Started" button in the header were not working because:

1. **Header buttons** were calling `handleNavigation('signin')` and `handleNavigation('signup')`
2. **App.tsx navigation handler** didn't have cases for 'signin' and 'signup'
3. **Buttons were doing nothing** when clicked

## 🔧 Solution Applied

### Fixed the Navigation Handler in `App.tsx`

Added missing cases to the `handleNavigation` function:

```tsx
switch (section) {
  case "home":
    setCurrentPage("home");
    break;
  case "signin": // ← ADDED
    setAuthMode("signin");
    setCurrentPage("auth");
    break;
  case "signup": // ← ADDED
    setAuthMode("signup");
    setCurrentPage("auth");
    break;
  // ... rest of cases
}
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes

### Header Buttons Now Work:

- ✅ **"Sign In" button** → Opens login modal
- ✅ **"Get Started" button** → Opens signup modal

### LandingPage Buttons Already Worked:

- ✅ **"Start Mastering Now"** → Calls `handleTryMastering()`
- ✅ **"View All Plans"** → Calls `handleGetStarted()`

## 🚀 Deployment Status

- ✅ **Fix deployed** to https://crysgarage.studio
- ✅ **New JavaScript build** uploaded (`index-12452359.js`)
- ✅ **All buttons should now be functional**

## 🧪 Testing

You can now test:

1. **Header "Sign In" button** - Should open login modal
2. **Header "Get Started" button** - Should open signup modal
3. **Landing page "Start Mastering Now"** - Should work for authenticated users
4. **Landing page "View All Plans"** - Should work for all users

## 📝 Technical Details

The issue was in the navigation routing logic. The Header component was correctly calling the navigation handler, but the handler didn't know how to handle 'signin' and 'signup' routes. Now it properly:

1. Sets the authentication mode (signin/signup)
2. Opens the auth modal page
3. Allows users to complete the authentication flow

The fix is now live on your website! 🎉
