# SSL/HTTPS Fix Summary

## Problem

The Crys Garage website was unreachable via HTTPS (port 443) with `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors, even though HTTP (port 80) was working internally on the server.

## Root Cause

Nginx was only configured to listen on port 80 (HTTP) and had no SSL/HTTPS configuration, even though SSL certificates existed at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/crysgarage.studio/`.

## Solution Applied

1. **Updated Nginx Configuration** (`nginx_fixed.conf`):

   - Added `listen 443 ssl;` directive
   - Added SSL certificate paths:
     - `ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/crysgarage.studio/fullchain.pem`
     - `ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/crysgarage.studio/privkey.pem`
   - Added SSL protocols and ciphers for security
   - Added HTTP to HTTPS redirect

2. **Applied Configuration**:
   - Uploaded updated config to server
   - Tested configuration syntax with `nginx -t`
   - Reloaded Nginx with `nginx -s reload`

## Verification

- ✅ Nginx now listening on port 443: `tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:443 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 720866/nginx`
- ✅ HTTPS site accessible: `curl -I https://crysgarage.studio` returns HTTP/1.1 200 OK
- ✅ JavaScript assets loading: `curl -I https://crysgarage.studio/assets/index-ae305da9.js` returns HTTP/1.1 200 OK

## Current Status

The Crys Garage website is now fully accessible via HTTPS at https://crysgarage.studio with proper SSL encryption. The login modal should now work correctly since the frontend assets are loading properly over HTTPS.

## Next Steps

The user can now:

1. Visit https://crysgarage.studio in their browser
2. Test the login/signup modal functionality
3. Verify that the modal can be cancelled/closed properly
4. Continue with local development and use the deployment scripts for updates
