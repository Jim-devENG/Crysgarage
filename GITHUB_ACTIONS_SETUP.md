# ðŸš€ GitHub Actions Deployment Setup

## âœ… **What This Gives You**

Instead of running scripts manually, you'll have:

- **Automatic deployment** when you push to GitHub
- **One-click deployment** from GitHub Actions dashboard
- **Deployment history** and logs
- **Status monitoring** and notifications
- **Rollback capability** if something goes wrong

## ðŸ”§ **Setup Steps**

### **Step 1: Add GitHub Secrets**

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/Jim-devENG/Crysgarage`
2. Click **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. Add these secrets:

```
VPS_HOST = 209.74.80.162
VPS_USERNAME = root
VPS_PORT = 22
VPS_SSH_KEY = [Your SSH private key content]
```

### **Step 2: Generate SSH Key (if you don't have one)**

```bash
# On your local machine
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "github-actions@crysgarage.studio"
```

### **Step 3: Add SSH Key to VPS**

```bash
# Copy your public key to VPS
ssh-copy-id root@209.74.80.162

# Or manually add to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on VPS
```

### **Step 4: Test the Setup**

1. Push any change to your repository
2. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
3. Watch the deployment run automatically

## ðŸŽ¯ **How to Use**

### **Automatic Deployment**

- Just push to `master` branch
- GitHub Actions will automatically deploy
- Check the **Actions** tab for progress

### **Manual Deployment**

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Click **Deploy to VPS**
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Select branch and click **Run workflow**

### **Monitor Deployments**

- View deployment history in **Actions** tab
- Check logs for any errors
- Get notifications on success/failure

## ðŸ“Š **Deployment Dashboard**

Open `deployment-dashboard.html` in your browser to:

- Monitor application status
- Check container health
- View recent deployments
- Trigger manual deployments
- Access logs

## ðŸ”„ **Workflow**

1. **You make changes** locally
2. **Push to GitHub** (`git push origin master`)
3. **GitHub Actions** automatically triggers
4. **VPS pulls changes** and rebuilds containers
5. **Application updates** seamlessly
6. **Health check** confirms success

## ðŸš¨ **Troubleshooting**

### **If deployment fails:**

1. Check **Actions** tab for error logs
2. Verify SSH key is correct
3. Ensure VPS is accessible
